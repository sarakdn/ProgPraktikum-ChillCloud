# ChillCloud
ChillCLoud is a cloud computing system with integrated self-healing concepts. The product itself is a cloud platform on which users can host applications. Cloud System wasn't designed by us, OpenStack  system has been used instead. We intend to analyze possible errors in a cloud computing environment on the basis of existing literature. Based on this, we will develop a process that collects data from the system, analyzes it and reacts accordingly in the event of an error.

# OpenStack setup
In order to provide customers private cloud with IaaS OpenStack was deployed using Kolla Ansible on virtual machines. Complete overview of cloud system would be possible to get through Horizon Dashboard shortly.
